   The main purpose of this Node is to publish Input Audio(Numpy array) and some of its features such as Decibel and
   Frequency. It publishes to two major Topics namely /opencog/AudioFeature and /opencog/change. The first one contains Decibel and Frequency of a given chunk as a String with "Decibel_Frequency" format. The second one holds 0 -
   for No Sudden Change Events and 10 for events which have sudden change.Better to change the THRESHOLD value based on the performance of speaker on the Robot.
